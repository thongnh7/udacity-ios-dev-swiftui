# Projects for Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree

## Overview
This repo contains the SwiftUI-based implementation for all the projects in the Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree Program. Due to the current lacking of certain functionalities in SwiftUI, some UIKit components are used too.

## Projects

#### Perfect Pitch
An app that records some audio and plays it back with different audio effects.

#### MemeMe 1.0
The first version of the MemeMe app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter, and by SMS or email.

#### MemeMe 2.0
The second version of the MemeMe app that, besides the functionality in the first version, can also show Memes in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

#### On the Map
An app with a map that shows location information posted by other users. The map will contain pins that show the location where other users have reported. By tapping on the pin, the poster's name and URL will show. The user will be able to post their own location by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.

#### Virtual Tourist
An app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app will allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist the pictures, and their association with the pin.

#### GIFU (Final Project)
An app that allows users to search for GIFs using keywords, as well as to explore trending GIFs. A more detailed README is in the corresponding folder.
